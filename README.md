## Getting specific on our project

The [video that Max shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A&feature=youtu.be) on Ant Colonization looked cool, so I did some further research.

I found that in the field of Ant Colony Optimization, the work done in 2004 by Marco Dorigo and Thomas Stutzle is highly cited. Particularly, [this paper/book](https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/~gdicaro/15382/additional/aco-book.pdf) seems to be a great resource. The book includes a [link to a webpage with various Ant Colony Optimization implementations](https://www.aco-metaheuristic.org/aco-code/) that hasn't been modified since 2012. 

According to our [project overview](https://www.wgilpin.com/cphy/vignettes/project.html), one way to approach our project is

> Look for creative but underappreciated older methods papers in your field, especially where the authorâ€™s code is unavailable, where the implementation is in a very different language like FORTRAN or Perl, or where the provided code is poorly documented. A clean, easy-to-use implementation of an uncommon method often proves very valuable.

So I think that reimplementing one of the software packages listed on [the website](https://www.aco-metaheuristic.org/aco-code/) in Python would be a great way to do our project.

I noticed that the first entry was implemented in [Omnet++](https://omnetpp.org/), which is a C++ simulation library. It was also created in 1998, so a modern implemenation could be valuable. I couldn't find the 1998 version of the code, but I did find a [2005 post on omnet++'s website](https://omnetpp.org/download-items/Antnet.html) with a download link.

Looking at the source code, I think this is a good candidate for something to work on. I am open to feedback.
